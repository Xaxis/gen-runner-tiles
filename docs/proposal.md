## ‚ùå Critical Issues & Research-Based Solutions

### 1. TESSELLATION QUALITY ISSUES

**Current Problem**: Basic edge blending
```python
blended_edge = (edge_a + edge_b) / 2  # Too simplistic!
```

**Research-Based Solution**: **Poisson Blending**
- Used in professional texture synthesis (Adobe Photoshop's "Content-Aware Fill")
- Preserves texture details while ensuring seamless edges
- Better than simple averaging for maintaining pixel art aesthetics

### 2. PIXEL ART QUALITY ISSUES

**Current Problem**: No pixel-perfect constraints
- Anti-aliasing may blur pixel edges
- Color bleeding between adjacent pixels
- Inconsistent pixel grid alignment

**Research-Based Solution**:
- **Post-process quantization** to nearest pixel grid
- **Color palette enforcement** (limit to 16-32 colors per tile)
- **Dithering algorithms** for smooth gradients in pixel art style

### 3. GAME ENGINE INTEGRATION GAPS

**Current Problem**: Missing game-ready outputs
- No tilemap metadata for engines like Unity/Godot
- No collision masks for solid/passable areas
- No animation frames for animated tiles

**Research-Based Solution**:
- **Tilemap JSON export** compatible with Tiled Map Editor
- **Collision mask generation** based on structure composition
- **Sprite sheet organization** with proper padding

### 4. MULTI-TILE COORDINATION WEAKNESSES

**Current Problem**: Infrequent edge coordination
```python
if i % 3 == 0:  # Every 3 steps - too infrequent!
    latents = self._apply_edge_coordination(latents)
```

**Research-Based Solution**:
- **Every-step coordination** for better seamless results
- **Cross-tile attention** mechanisms (research from "Seamless Texture Synthesis")
- **Shared latent regions** for overlapping areas

### 5. THEME CONSISTENCY ISSUES

**Current Problem**: Style drift between independently generated tiles

**Research-Based Solution**:
- **Style transfer loss** to maintain consistent aesthetics
- **Color palette extraction** from reference images
- **Texture coherence metrics** across the tileset

### 6. PERFORMANCE & SCALABILITY

**Current Problem**: 28 steps √ó 15-30 minutes = too slow for iteration

**Research-Based Solution**:
- **Progressive generation** (start with 8 steps, refine to 28)
- **Tile caching** for similar connectivity patterns
- **Batch generation** of multiple tilesets
